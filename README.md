## Challenges & Solutions

### 1️⃣ Supabase OAuth Redirect Issues  
**Problem:** Google login worked locally but failed after deploying to Vercel due to redirect URL mismatch.  
**Solution:** Properly configured Supabase Authentication → URL Configuration with production Site URL and Redirect URLs.

---

### 2️⃣ Invalid Refresh Token Error  
**Problem:** Encountered `AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found` during development.  
**Cause:** Expired or missing session cookies.  
**Solution:** Implemented proper session handling and cleared invalid tokens during re-authentication.

### 3️⃣ Real-time Sync Not Updating Across Tabs  
**Problem:** Bookmarks were not instantly updating across multiple browser tabs.  
**Solution:** Enabled Supabase Realtime replication and correctly subscribed to database changes.

### 4️⃣ Deployment Environment Variable Issues  
**Problem:** App worked locally but failed on production due to missing environment variables.  
**Solution:** Added required Supabase keys in Vercel Environment Variables and redeployed.
